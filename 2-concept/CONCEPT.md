# Concept description

## UniSurf

     (US) => Us = we the students

## _WHO_ are the users you have in mind? (Add specifics or characteristics of the users) (> 50 words)

Our envisioned users are students, particularly international ones unfamiliar with local areas. They seek inexpensive exploration methods, like couch surfing, residing temporarily in fellow students' homes or dormitories. These are adventurous individuals, eager to traverse the globe, overcome geographical unfamiliarity, and form diverse cultural connections.

## _WHAT_ problem will the app help the users to solve? (Describe various use cases) (> 50 words)

This app addresses the challenge of finding cost-effective accommodations while traveling. It enables users to experience cities from a local's viewpoint, enhancing their understanding of different cultures. Through informal networking opportunities, it encourages community building. Additionally, the app helps uncover hidden gems in various countries, promoting global exploration beyond typical tourist spots.

## _HOW_ are users solving the problem now? (Without your app) (> 75 words)

Presently, students, especially those from overseas, navigate disjointed solutions like Facebook groups for event updates and LinkedIn for networking. However, these platforms offer inconsistent information access and formal, professional connections, respectively. Finding affordable accommodations and local attractions involves time-consuming, manual searches. Thus, without a centralized, informal networking tool, students juggle multiple platforms, hampering efficiency and limiting their opportunities for cost-effective travel and genuine cultural experiences.

## _HOW_ can the users solve the problem with your app? (> 75 words)

Our app centralizes information about city events, including user ratings, to guide decision-making. Students can search for peers from specific colleges who share common interests, enhancing socialization in unfamiliar locales. Publicly available data, like name, school, and program, aids in this connection process. The app also facilitates preparation for cost-effective travels, offering affordable, local-centric tourist experiences. Users gain insights into cities from a local perspective while simultaneously experiencing authentic student life. This integrated platform streamlines travel, exploration, and networking, creating a more enriching, efficient journey for students.
